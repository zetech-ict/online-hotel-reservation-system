## INTRODUCTION
An online hotel reservation system helps in making and booking reservations. This benefits big hotels and also improves customer service. A well-developed ohrs are designed to help people from all across the globe not having to come into hotels to make the reservations themselves but instead, all they need is their home personal computer to access the internet and a credit card to make payments from wherever they are.

## user interface design
I was able to design a high-quality system that meets all expectations and is very efficient as planned. I used the system development life cycle and various soft wares such as SQL server since the ohrs was designed to handle large volumes of data thus a database was required and the data base management system was of help. The following are design flow chat that aided in the process of designing.
